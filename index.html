      <h2>Getting To Know Charles !</h2>
      <p>
        Charles Marshall is an aspiring network engineer with deep interests in
        technology and economics. He is currently a rising junior @ SUNY Fredonia.
        At school, he maintains academics and leadership positions. Outside of the classroom, Charles Marshall
        constantly works on his coding projects and helps the Harlem community.
        Aside from technology and programming, he studies different aspects of
        business and programming from a variety of books and online resources.He
        hopes one day to give back to his community in the Bronx and start a
        program to help kids learn how to code. He looks forward to similar
        experiences and opportunities, throughout his years in college at the
        State University of Fredonia he always will be willing to work with this team
        improve. He feels we should make kids open to joining as well as
        maintaining your grades which aren't implemented as it should be. Being
        on the Robotics Team it gave me experiences like dealing with kids who people would
        think are weird and opportunities that he couldn't even imagine join
        programs that inspired him to do better in life.

        Article 2 - Coding is an honorable trade, but weâ€™ve accidentally adopted
        the fantasy that learning to code is a surefire path to becoming an
        innovative, independent thinker.
