      All Star Code is a nonprofit computer science education organization focused on motivated Black and Latino young men. Few organizations prepare this underserved group for careers in the innovation economy. Our ultimate goal is to close the wealth, income and opportunity gaps.All Star Code was founded on principles that guide our mission and our view of social change. These principles also determine how we work as a team and how we support our students. All Star Code is developing a new generation of entrepreneurs who have the tools they need to succeed in technology. We give young men the skills, networks, and mindsets they need through our flagship program, the Summer Intensive, a six-week coding bootcamp, and our continued Alumni Services.
Increasing professional access and STEM education for Blacks and Latinos is vital to the overall growth of the tech sector, minority communities, and the US economy as a whole.

  We are a group of sleep deprived high school students dedicated to connecting young builders everywhere. We strive to redefine the word "hacker" to someone who creates things with code and/or hardware. We do this through local hackathons and feild trips to tech companies around New York City. Our events are diverse and aim to attract members of all groups. We make sure to introduce beginners to the world of creating through workshops at all our events.

  Our mission is to inspire urban minority students to become the innovators and engineers of the future through the exciting challenge of designing and building a robot capable of competing in the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition in Science and Technology) Robotics Competition. With the support of faculty and volunteer mentors, the Harlem Knights Robotics Team fosters important life skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership and gracious professionalism while seeking to raise awareness and appreciation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the Harlem community.
